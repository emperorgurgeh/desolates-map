The desolates map is built using three main technologies:

-   The map itself uses p5js, a visual rendering library
-   The project is wrapped on a nextjs container
-   Tailwind is used for CSS styling

To install dependencies, run:

```
cd next-desolates-map
yarn
```

To develop and use a local server, run (from within the next-desolates-map folder):

```
yarn dev
```

To build a compiled version:

```
yarn build
```

And for uploading, follow the rules of your hosting. If you use vercel, simply push to your github repo or run

```
vercel --prod
```
